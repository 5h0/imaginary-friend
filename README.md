# ------Siri, but not quite there yet------ #

This project is going to be something that we'll be working on for quite some time, since the idea itself opens up so many possibilities. The main idea is to make a speech-recognition software that will, based on audio input, perform various tasks. Some of the tasks, for example, would be shutting down the PC, restarting, opening the terminal, opening a website, searching on Google, etc.

Programming language: Python (we will see which version will fit us the best)

Other technologies: We have to decide which speech-recognition library we are going to use, but candidates that currently come to mind are:
- google-cloud-speech
- pocketsphinx
- SpeechRecognition
- apiai

Other than that, we might incorporate various other libraries, depending on the tasks we are going to implement for 'baby Siri'
